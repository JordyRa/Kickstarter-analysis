# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analysis of crowdfunding data with general statistics. 

### Purpose
There are two purposes of this analysis:
1. To help Louise, as an Excel power user, by analizing crowdfunding data and best assess her in her crowdfunding campaign for her play "Fever". 
2. Put my bootcamp learnings in Excel to test.

## Analysis and Challenges
I performed the analysis by using the things I've learned in the Bootcamp classes as well as on canvas. 
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
With this analysis you can get an idea of the seasonality in which theaters campaigns are launched and know which season, or month, has the biggest number of successful or failed campaigns. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This analysis helps you know the outcome of theater campaigns based on the amount they fixed as goal. These could help you set a goal based on the amounts that set other succsessful ones. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not encountered any big challenges but the CountIfs() function put me in a little pickle. Actually all the instructions we're very clear but you need to know what you're doing if you don't want to have any mistakes. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. May is, historically, the month with more successful theater campaigns, but also the month with more failed campaigns. 
2. Theater campaigns launched in October have never been canceled. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the data, if you want your play campaign to be successful, you have a best chance by setting a goal of less than $1,000. You can also go for a goal from $1,000 - 4,999 or 35,000 - 44,999 and still have a good chance for it to be successful. All the plays which goal was set between $45,000 - 49,000 have failed and only 13% of the play campaings which goal was $50,000, have been successful. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
I can't think of any.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For example: 
The percentage of succsessful campaigns by country. 
How well did the successful campaings go, by showing the percentage funded of each one and you can sort it by category or by country.
